1. Appropriate use of containers

There are several containers being used throughout this application, which will be listed below.

ArrayList<City>(): This was used to implement the Composite Pattern, as this container will allow to store
                   the objects of CityComponent, which is the non-leaf node in the network and 
                   CityBuilding, the leaf node in the network.

Stack<City>(): This container was used in toString(). Stack is used to access each of the node in the 
               networks in a hierarchical manners due to its Last-In-First-Out.

Queue<City>(): Queue was used in the RandomGenerator class to create a random child as the program 
               iterates from root to leaf.

HashMap<String,Double>(): This container was used to store the sets of power consumption type with
                          its value. So that whenever the program would like to get the consumption 
                          value of a type, it will just need to supply the type.



2. The application is splitted into three main packages, which are model, view, and controller.

    - model: Handles the logic of the application. Model is responsible to process data and return the 
             data to the controller. For example, the Generator in the model is responsible to read the
             file and generate the tree accordingly. Then, it will return the entire tree to the controller.

    - view: Handles the interaction between user and the program. It will display or output the data 
            being processed by model. For example, after the generator had generated the tree and returned 
            to controller, the controller will pass the tree to print method in view to output the result
            either to the screen or to the file.

    - controller: Controls the communication between model and the view. For example, controller will 
                  interpret the arguments input by user and call FileGenerator if -g was selected and 
                  call ScreenDisplay's print method if -d was selected.

    All the names of the class found in model, view, and controller represents their specific roles.
    For example, WriteFileTree class handles in writing the result of the tree to the specified file,
    RandomGenerator will generate the tree based on randomised value found in a file.



3. Appropriate error handling

Every possible exceptions caused by user error such as misinput, typos, and invalid arguments in the program
will be handled in an organised way in the controller. The controller will then call the print method in the 
view to display the error into the console screen. In this case, the model does not need to worry about the 
handling the error as it will just handles the logic of the system. Same case goes to the view, it does not
need to know about the exception or the error being thrown, it will just be responsible in displaying whatever
message that was passed from the controller. 



4. Appropriate use of the Strategy Pattern and/or Template Method Pattern

The Strategy Pattern was used for three times in this application. 

Which can be found in,

view: The Output.java interface was implemented by PrintMessage.java, 
      ScreenDisplay.java, and WriteFileTree.java.
